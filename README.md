# brain-game

As a follow up to MILO, our mind-controlled locomotive project last semester, we are creating a mind-controlled platform game to help gamify data collection for future projects.

Previously, data collection was quite boring - subjects were simply asked to imagine moving either their right or left hand, and the task also required some training for better efficiency. Our game will help make data collection more fun for subjects, and hopefully ease the training required as well.
